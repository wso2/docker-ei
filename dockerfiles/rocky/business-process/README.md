# Dockerfile for Business Process Server profile of WSO2 Enterprise Integrator #

This section defines the step-by-step instructions to build a [RockyLinux](https://hub.docker.com/_/rockylinux) based Docker image
Business Process Server profile for WSO2 Enterprise Integrator 6.5.0.

## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) v17.09.0 or above
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) client

## How to build an image and run

##### 1. Checkout this repository into your local machine using the following Git client command.

```
git clone https://github.com/wso2/docker-ei.git
```

>The local copy of the `dockerfiles/ubuntu/business-process` directory will be referred to as `BPS_DOCKERFILE_HOME` from this point onwards.

##### 2. Build the Docker image.

- Navigate to `<BPS_DOCKERFILE_HOME>` directory. <br>
  Execute `docker build` command as shown below.
    + `docker build -t wso2ei-business-process:6.5.0-rocky .`

> By default, the Docker image will prepackage the General Availability (GA) release version of the relevant WSO2 product.

##### 3. Running the Docker image.

- `docker run -p 9445:9445 ...all-port-mappings-here... wso2ei-business-process:6.5.0-rocky`

>Here, only port 9445 (HTTPS servlet transport) has been mapped to a Docker host port.
You may map other container service ports, which have been exposed to Docker host ports, as desired.

##### 4. Accessing management console.

- To access the management console, use the docker host IP and port 9445.
    + `https:<DOCKER_HOST>:9445/carbon`

>In here, <DOCKER_HOST> refers to hostname or IP of the host machine on top of which containers are spawned.

## How to update configurations

Configurations would lie on the Docker host machine and they can be volume mounted to the container. <br>
As an example, steps required to change the port offset using `carbon.xml` is as follows:

##### 1. Stop the Business Process Server profile container if it's already running.

In Business Process Server profile product distribution, `carbon.xml` configuration file can be found at `<DISTRIBUTION_HOME>/wso2/business-process/conf`.
Copy the file to some suitable location of the host machine, referred to as `<SOURCE_CONFIGS>/carbon.xml` and
increase the offset value under ports by 1.

##### 2. Grant read permission to `other` users for `<SOURCE_CONFIGS>/carbon.xml`.

```
chmod o+r <SOURCE_CONFIGS>/carbon.xml
```

##### 3. Run the image by mounting the file to container as follows:

```
docker run \
-p 9446:9446 \
--volume <SOURCE_CONFIGS>/carbon.xml:<TARGET_CONFIGS>/carbon.xml \
wso2ei-business-process:6.5.0-rocky
```

>In here, <TARGET_CONFIGS> refers to /home/wso2carbon/wso2ei-6.5.0/wso2/business-process/conf folder of the container.
